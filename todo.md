# todo

### CODE

 * add power losses to the generator dynamics
 * get a reference trajectory that we like
 * trajectory tracking costs for MPC
 * fast MPC with SNOPT (updating costs only)
 * Wrap MPC in a PyDrake Controller class
 * Clean up animation code (add MPC vis?)

### Extra

 * Try LQR (no constraints)
 * consider trying MPC with linearized dynamics

### WRITEUP

 * do this
